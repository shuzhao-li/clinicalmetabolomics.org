	<p>From Wikipedia: The exposome encompasses the totality of human environmental (i.e. non-genetic) exposures from conception onwards, complementing the genome. It was first proposed by Dr. Christopher Wild, a cancer epidemiologist, in a 2005 article entitled "Complementing the Genome with an “Exposome”: The Outstanding Challenge of Environmental Exposure Measurement in Molecular Epidemiology.".[1] The concept of the exposome and how to assess it has led to lively discussions with varied views.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] Although at this stage it may not be possible to measure or model the full exposome, some recent European projects such as HELIX ([8] http://www.projecthelix.eu/), EXPOsOMICS ([12] http://www.exposomicsproject.eu/), and HEALS (http://www.heals-eu.eu/) and the American initiative HERCULES (http://emoryhercules.com/) have started to make first attempts.</p>
