	<h4>Human diseases through molecular signatures</h4>
	While genomics serves as a blueprint of a human being, personal health is also a product of life history and interactions with the environment. Big data from high-throughput molecular technologies (e.g. transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and immunomics) thus provide critical information towards health monitoring, disease diagnosis and treatment. We use high-resolution mass spectrometry to detect the molecular footprints of human diseases.

	<h4>What's in a metabolome?</h4>
	Core nutritional metabolome contains required nutrients and related biochemicals derived via biological enzymes. 
	The food metabolome contains many components of this core nutritional metabolome and also a large number of other non-nutritive chemicals. The pan-metabolome also contains microbiome-related chemicals derived from food metabolites, drugs and other environmental agents acted upon by the intestinal microbes. Other components of the pan-metabolome are derived from dietary supplements and pharmaceuticals, commercial products such as sun screen and face creams, and environmental chemicals. (Jones, D. P., Park, Y., Ziegler, T. R. (2012). Annual review of nutrition, 32: 183.) </div>

	<h4>From systems biology to medicine</h4>
	Big `omics` data need to be integrated with other clinical and scientific investigations to deliver their clinical and societal impacts. To this end, we develop and employ computational methods to reason within big data and to model disease processes. (Li et al. (2013) Seminars in immunology, 25:209; artwork by Helder Nakaya.)
