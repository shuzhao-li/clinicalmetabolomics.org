He is the Director of the Clinical Biomarkers Laboratory and lead the collaborative team developing high-resolution metabolomics for personalized medicine. 
		 He received a B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Illinois, Urbana, in 1971 and a Ph.D in Biochemistry from Oregon Health Sciences UniversityPortland, in 1976. He was a National Sciences Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow in Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University, Ithaca, and a Visiting Scientist in Molecular Toxicology at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, prior to moving to Emory University as Assistant Professor of Biochemistry in 1979. In 1997-98, he was a Nobel Fellow at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm. Dr. Jones has over 200 peer-reviewed publications and over 120 invited reviews and book chapters. He has edited volumes on mitochondrial toxicity and microcompartmentation of metabolism. He received the Albert E. Levy Research Award, the most prestigious research award of Emory University.

	<h4>Shuzhao Li</h4>
	<p>Assistant Professor, Associate Director of Clinical Biomarkers Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Emory University</p>
	<p>Dr. Li was trained in bioinformatics, and he has been combining computational developments with metabolomics and systems biology. His work in human immunology applied large-scale data integration and network modeling to delineate transcriptomic programs for antibody response induced by several vaccines. These are early steps towards quantitative and systems modeling of human immunity, which is an integral part of most human diseases. His mummichog software brought genome-scale metabolic models into the field of high throughput metabolomics, and enabled pathway/network analysis for untargeted metabolomics. He strives to bring these scientific developments to personalized and precision medicine.

	<h4>Karan Uppal</h4>
	<p>Senior developer, Department Medicine, Emory University</p>
	<p>I have a formal training in Bioinformatics with a focus on the development and application of statistical and data mining techniques for analyzing high-throughput -omics data. I developed xMSanalyzer that optimizes the performance of existing LC/MS data processing software such as apLCMS and XCMS for improved feature detection. The software allows detection of quantitatively reliable low abundance and variable chemicals and chemicals that are present in only small subset of samples. I have the expertise to integrate heterogeneous data (metabolomics and gene expressession; metabolomics and proteomics) and identify the network structure or modules of co-regulating metabolites, which would assist in characterizing the association of the unknown chemicals with respect to diseases, clinical traits, and biological pathways. I also have experience in database and Flex, PHP, ActionScript, and JavaScript based web application development. </p>

	<h4>Douglas I. Walker</h4>
	<p>Douglas Walker is a Ph.D. candidate from Tufts University and has been trained in environmental chemistry, analytical methods for quantifying environmental pollutants and mass spectrometric based chemical profiling techniques. The primary focus of his research is to integrate measures of environmental exposure, health outcomes and high performance metabolomics (HPM) in both animal models and human populations. Application of this framework using advanced biostatistic/bioinformatic techniques provides a component for sequencing the human exposome and understanding the contribution of exogenous factors in disease pathophysiology. Mr. Walker also hopes to develop HPM platforms for universal and cost-effective surveillance of anthropogenic chemicals in human populations, commercial products and ecosystems. Rapid identification and quantification of the distribution of environmental pollutants is a critical first step in protecting natural resources and mitigating exposure associated health risks.</p>
